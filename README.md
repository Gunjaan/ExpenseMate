# ExpenseMate

ExpenseMate is a Flutter application that provides a visual representation of expenses categorized into different buckets. It helps users gain insights into their spending habits by displaying a chart with bars representing each expense category.

### Key Features:

Categorized Expense Chart: The app fetches a list of expenses and categorizes them into different buckets, such as food, travel, leisure, work, shopping, bills, and other miscellaneous expenses. It then displays a chart with bars representing each expense category.

Visual Representation: The height of each bar in the chart corresponds to the total expenses for that category. The bars provide a visual representation of the distribution of expenses across different categories.

User-friendly Design: The app follows Material Design principles and provides an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface. It utilizes responsive layouts and spacing to ensure optimal viewing experience on different devices.
